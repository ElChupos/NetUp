# NetUp
A simple uptime monitor for local internet connections.

Polls www.google.com at 10 second intervals and stores a success or fail reason. You can then output the entire history to a text file for analysis.

I've been having internet dropouts lately so this was just to get some idea of stability over long periods of time in order to go to my ISP with more information.
